### 01. React Top-Level API

---

---

### 02. Components

---

Types of react components

1. React.Component
2. React.PureComponent

React components can also be defined as functions which can be wrapped:

1. React.memo

---

### 03. Creating React Elements

---

createElement()
createFactory()

---

### 04. Transforming Elements

---

React provides several APIs for manipulating elements:

1. cloneElement()
2. isValidElement()
3. React.Children

---

### 05. Fragments

---

React also provides a component for rendering multiple elements without a wrapper.

1. React.Fragment

---

### 06. Refs

---

1. React.createRef
2. React.forwardRef

---

### 07. Suspense

---

Suspense lets components “wait” for something before rendering.

1. React.lazy
2. React.Suspense

---

### 08. Transitions

---

Transitions are a new concurrent feature introduced in React 18.

1. React.startTransition
2. React.useTransition

---

### 09. Hooks

---

- Basic Hooks

1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useContext

- Additional Hooks

1. useReducer
2. useRef
3. useCallback
4. useMemo
5. useImperativeHandle
6. useLayoutEffect
7. useDebugValue
8. useDeferredValue
9. useTransition
10. useId

- Library Hooks

1. useSyncExternalStore
2. useInsertionEffect

---

### 10. Reference

---

---

### 11. React.Component

---

React.Component is the base class for React components when they are defined using ES6 classes

---

```

class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

```

### 12. React.PureComponent

---

If your React component’s render() function renders the same result given the same props and state, you can use React.PureComponent

---

### 13. React.memo

---

If your component renders the same result given the same props, you can wrap it in a call to React.memo for a performance boost in some cases by memoizing the result. This means that React will skip rendering the component, and reuse the last rendered result.

React.memo only checks for prop changes. If your function component wrapped in React.memo has a useState, useReducer or useContext Hook in its implementation, it will still rerender when state or context change.

By default it will only shallowly compare complex objects in the props object. If you want control over the comparison, you can also provide a custom comparison function as the second argument.

---

```
EX: 1

const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  /* render using props */
});


EX: 2

function MyComponent(props) {
  /* render using props */
}
function areEqual(prevProps, nextProps) {
  /*
  return true if passing nextProps to render would return
  the same result as passing prevProps to render,
  otherwise return false
  */
}
export default React.memo(MyComponent, areEqual);
```

### 14. createElement()

---

React.createElement(
type,
[props],
[...children]
)

---

### 15. cloneElement()

---

---

### 16. createFactory()

---

---

### 17. isValidElement()

---

---

### 18. React.Children

---

---

### 19. React.Fragment

---

The React.Fragment component lets you return multiple elements in a render() method without creating an additional DOM element. You can also use it with the shorthand <></> syntax

---

### 20. React.createRef

---

## React.createRef creates a ref that can be attached to React elements via the ref attribute.

### 21. React.forwardRef

---

React.forwardRef creates a React component that forwards the ref attribute it receives to another component below in the tree. React.forwardRef accepts a rendering function as an argument. React will call this function with props and ref as two arguments.

---

### 22. React.lazy

---

React.lazy() lets you define a component that is loaded dynamically.

---

```
// This component is loaded dynamically
const SomeComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./SomeComponent'));
```

### 23. React.Suspense

---

React.Suspense lets you specify the loading indicator in case some components in the tree below it are not yet ready to render.

---

### 24. React.startTransition

---

---

```
React.startTransition(callback)
```
