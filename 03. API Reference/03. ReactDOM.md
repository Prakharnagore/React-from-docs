The react-dom package exports these methods:

### 03. Reference

---

---

### 04. createPortal()

---

Creates a portal. Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the hierarchy of the DOM component.

---

```
createPortal(child, container)
```

### 05. flushSync()

---

Force React to flush any updates inside the provided callback synchronously. This ensures that the DOM is updated immediately.

---

```
// Force this state update to be synchronous.
flushSync(() => {
  setCount(count + 1);
});
// By this point, DOM is updated.
```
